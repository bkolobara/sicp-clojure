# About

This is a collection of my solutions to exercises from the book
Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs done in Clojure.

> ***Warning:*** I can't garanty the correctness of the solutions.
> I wrote this code while I was learning Clojure and functional
> programming, so some of the code may not be idiomatic Clojure.
